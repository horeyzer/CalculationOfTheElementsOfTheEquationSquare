# CalculationOfTheElementsOfTheEquationSquare
(USING THE SWITCH  INSTRUCTIONS)
Please write a program that will calculate the roots of the quadratic equation
ax2+bx+c= 0 using the switch selection statement, where variables a, b, c are 
real numbers entered from the keyboard.
Variables a, b, c, x1 and x2 should be displayed on the screen with an accuracy 
of two decimal places.
Hints:
1. We check if the user has not entered zero as "a".
2. We calculate the delta and determine the number of elements.
3. Depending on the number of roots in the switch statement, we execute
specific actions (we calculate x1 or x1 and x2).
